The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods,blocks
 and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
I used static keyword in my framework for utility classes like dropdownUtil,ActionsUtil,synchronisationUtil,AlertUtil
For ex in dropdownUtil I make selectByindex,selectByvisibletext,selectByvalue these methods as static .So that I can make 
use of this methods without creating a object.In this way we can manage memory by using static keyword.
 I have used static keyword for declaring driver object in singleton design pattern .By declaring driver as static we 
can use this across all the classes and framework.
